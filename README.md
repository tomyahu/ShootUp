# ShootUp

A browser online multiplayer game I made while streaming on the weekends. This game is a Platform Fighter Shooter, heavily inspired in [Superfighters](https://thesuperfighters.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page).

The game is made using node with express and sockets.io for the server, and Phaser 3 for the client. It is made so a player connects to a url and immediately they start playing.

## Requirements
* [Node](https://nodejs.org/es/download/)
	* express
	* http
	* path
	* sockets.io

* [Phaser 3](https://phaser.io/phaser3) (This must go in the folder "public/js")

## Running the game
To run the game just run server.js and you are ready. The game will run automatically on port 8080 on your computer. If you want to change the port you can do so by editing the server.js file.

That's it! Now you can play locally by going to [localhost:8080](localhost:8080). You can play with other people in your network with your local IP. To play with people online you would have to do port forwarding in your router.

If you don't know what a local IP Adress is or what/how do you do port forwarding well... I won't teach you that, its a lot. But if you google it I'm sure you'll figure it out!

## Future plans

I have currently no plans to keep working on the game currently (14/03/2022). There's a lot to do for this game though from quality of life upgrades:

* Show life as a lifebar
* Add an arrow to show who you are

to full on features:
* Add login to enter the game (name and password)
* Make bullets go faster (make them a line instead of a dot maybe?)
* Add more guns
* Polish the one level there is
* etc

I was planning on setting up donations and a small milestone (like 25 USD or smth) to see if there's interest in the game. I'll set up an itch.io page soon for it with a link where you can donate. If you have any doubts regarding my projects send me an email or contact me on twitter! (both of those links are in my profile)

ALSO I stream game development on Sundays at 6pm GMT-3 at [https://www.twitch.tv/atemo6](https://www.twitch.tv/atemo6) come and say hi if you want!
